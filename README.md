   ```

2. **Publish the Configuration**:

   ```

3. **Run Migrations**:

   Ensure your database is set up, then run:

## Usage

To use Laravel Userstamps, you need to include the trait in your Eloquent models. Here's how:

1. **Include the Trait**:

   In your model, include the `Userstamps` trait:

   ```php
   use Gopal137\Userstamps\Userstamps;

   class Post extends Model
   {
       use Userstamps;

       // Your model code here
   }
   ```

2. **Track User Actions**:

   Once the trait is included, the package will automatically track the user who created, updated, or deleted the model. You can access this information through the model's attributes.

3. **Example**:

   Hereâ€™s an example of creating a new post:

   ```php
   $post = new Post();
   $post->title = 'My First Post';
   $post->content = 'This is the content of my first post.';
   $post->save();

   echo $post->created_by; // Outputs the ID of the user who created the post
   ```

## Configuration

You can customize the package's behavior by editing the published configuration file located at `config/userstamps.php`. Here are some key settings:

- **User Model**: Define which user model to use for tracking.
- **Fields**: Specify which fields should be tracked.
- **Custom Logic**: Implement any custom logic for user tracking.
